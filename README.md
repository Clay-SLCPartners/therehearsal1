## Development

### Adding New Scenarios
Scenarios are defined in the `scenarios` object in `server.js`. Each scenario includes:
- Metadata (title, description, difficulty)
- AI persona definition
- Response patterns for different conversation types
- Initial messages and responses

### Database Integration
Currently uses in-memory storage. For production, consider:
- MongoDB for conversation storage
- Redis for session management
- PostgreSQL for user data and analytics

### Enhanced AI Integration
The server is prepared for OpenAI integration:
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment variables
- Modify `generateAIResponse()` function to use OpenAI API
- Implement more sophisticated conversation analysis

## Environment Variables

```bash
NODE_ENV=development          # Environment mode
PORT=3000                    # Server port
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key      # Optional: OpenAI API key
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret   # Session management secret
